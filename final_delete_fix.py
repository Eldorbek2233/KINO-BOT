1. ‚úÖ /delete command is PROPERLY ADDED to app.py
2. ‚úÖ All deletion functions are PRESENT
3. ‚úÖ Movies database is READY
4. ‚úÖ Admin logging is ENABLED

üéØ TO TEST THE SYSTEM:

Option 1 - Direct Bot Test:
  1. Run your bot: python app.py
  2. Send /delete to your bot
  3. You should see deletion menu
  4. Enter movie code (789, 123, or 456)
  5. Confirm deletion

Option 2 - Railway Deployment:
  1. Deploy to Railway
  2. Send /delete to your bot
  3. Test the deletion workflow

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING:

If /delete doesn't work:
- Check bot.log for errors
- Verify you're sending as admin
- Check internet connection
- Restart the bot

If deletion menu appears but codes don't work:
- The system should work automatically
- Check logs for session processing

üéâ SYSTEM STATUS: READY FOR TESTING!
